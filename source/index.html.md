# Introduction

Welcome to the Fullstop API! You can use our API to access Fullstop API endpoints, which can get information on violations, lifecycle, and useful informations in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate)
based on [Fullstop](https://github.com/zalando-stups/fullstop-slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Barer meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Fullstop uses Oauth2 tokens to allow access to the API.

Fullstop expects Oauth2 tokens to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Barer meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal Oauth2 token.
